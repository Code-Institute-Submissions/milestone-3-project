 # Brief
 
 In this project, youâ€™ll be building a logic-driven application using the technologies that you have learned throughout Practical Python. You can either choose to use the example brief below or choose to use your idea for the website.

### CREATE A 'RIDDLE-ME-THIS' GUESSING GAME

Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to a pictorial or text-based riddle.
The player is presented with an image or text that contains the riddle. Players enter their answer into a textarea and submit their answer using a form.
If a player guesses correctly, they are redirected to the next riddle.
If a player guesses incorrectly, their incorrect guess is stored and printed below the riddle. The textarea is cleared so they can guess again.
Multiple players can play an instance of the game at the same time, each in their own browser. Users are identified by a unique username, but note that no authentication features such as a password are required for this project.
Create a leaderboard that ranks top scores for all (at least recent) users.

### CREATE YOUR OWN PROJECT

If you choose to create your project outside the brief, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.
