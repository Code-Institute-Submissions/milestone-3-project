Milestone 3 Project

Riddle-Me-This

This project is all about having fun, while making a game which demonstrates Python as the backbone programming language.

The Game is designed to run on Heroku and will facilitate multiple players.  The players will be able to register their own unique usernames.  
A leader-board will show the scores of players from highest to lowest.
